ThronosChain Production Deployment Guide
========================================

Welcome to ThronosChain!  This package contains an updated snapshot of the
project with several important additions to support a minimal production
environment.  The highlights include:

* **Cryptographic Wallet Support** – The `wallet_crypto.py` module adds
  simple key generation and address derivation.  Run it to generate a new
  private/public key pair and Thronos address.  A sample keypair has been
  generated for you and stored in the file `wallet_keys.txt`.  The first
  address in that file will be used by the microminer when running on
  Railway.

* **MicroMiner Demonstration** – The `micro_miner.py` script performs a
  continuous SHA‑256 hashing loop, simulating the work of a miner.  While
  it does not submit blocks to the network, it helps demonstrate CPU
  activity and provides a starting point for integrating a real proof‑of‑work
  mining engine.

* **Stratum Job Engine** – `stratum_engine.py` implements a rudimentary
  Stratum server on port 3333.  It accepts connections from standard
  miners (e.g. cgminer, bfgminer or USB sticks), responds with a basic
  subscription acknowledgment and delivers a static mining job.  This
  implementation should be treated as a placeholder: it does not track
  shares or submit blocks to the Thronos blockchain.  Future versions
  should generate live job templates from the running chain and process
  share submissions.

* **Updated Start Script** – `start.sh` now launches the Stratum engine
  and microminer in the background before starting the Flask application.
  When the Flask process terminates, background services are shut down
  cleanly.  This script is suitable for deployment on Railway with the
  following configuration: set the Railway port to **3333** and the
  start command to `bash start.sh`.

Getting Started
---------------

1. **Review the sample wallet keys**: Open `wallet_keys.txt` in a secure
   location.  You will find a single THR address with its associated
   private and public keys.  Treat the private key as sensitive; anyone
   possessing it can control the funds associated with the address.

2. **Deploy on Railway**: Create a new service and upload the contents of
   this directory.  Configure the service as follows:

   - **Language/Build**: Python
   - **Start Command**: `bash start.sh`
   - **Port**: 3333 (this will expose the Stratum engine for miners)
   - **Environment Variables** (optional): You can set `STRATUM_HOST` or
     `STRATUM_PORT` to customise where the Stratum engine listens.
   - **Volume**: Attach a persistent volume if you want to keep ledger
     data between deployments.

3. **Connect Miners**: Point your cgminer/bfgminer or USB miner to your
   Railway service domain on port 3333 using the Stratum protocol.  Since
   the included Stratum engine serves a static job, miners will not earn
   real rewards yet, but this proves the connectivity chain.

4. **Extend for Production**: This package is intended as a starting
   point.  To operate a real public mining pool you will need to:
   - Implement proper block template generation and difficulty targeting.
   - Record shares submitted by miners and distribute THR rewards.
   - Provide transaction signing with the private keys generated by
     `wallet_crypto.py`.
   - Harden the wallet system with a fully fledged cryptography library.

5. **Pledge Participation**: Remember that new nodes must still submit a
   pledge (see the pledge system described in the whitepaper) to join
   ThronosChain.  This package does not implement the automated pledge
   submission, but server endpoints for pledges are available in
   `server.py`.

For further details on the network design, token economics and offline
propagation mechanisms, please consult `README_MAINNET.md` and the
whitepapers included in this distribution.  With this foundation in
place, you are now ready to bring ThronosChain to life!
