## SAfA Valor

*Role:* Team leader and morale booster.  SAfA (pronounced “Sah‑fah”) was the
first to discover cryptocurrency mining during the Greek debt crisis.  He has
the rare ability to read people and unite disparate talents, keeping hope alive
even when missions go sideways.  His presence increases the stamina and
efficiency of his squad.

## Niva ReBorN

*Role:* Cybersecurity specialist.  Niva is a prodigious coder who can dissect
malware and design rootkit countermeasures.  She thrives on solving complex
algorithms and enjoys teaching others the nuances of cryptographic puzzles.

## Nato Saka

*Role:* Systems architect and analyst.  Nato reconnects with SAfA after years
apart.  He excels at methodical analysis and can design complete ecosystems by
himself, but he realises his ideas reach their full potential only when
implemented with the team.

## Kyra Blaze

*Role:* Perimeter defender.  Kyra protects data integrity and erects digital
shields around critical infrastructure.  She sees decentralisation as a tool
for citizen empowerment and fights to ensure networks remain open and
uncorrupted.

## Luna Myst

*Role:* Operations engineer.  Luna keeps systems running smoothly even under
attack.  She understands the interplay between infrastructure and user
experience, and can scale resources quickly to meet demand.

## Zayne Nexus

*Role:* Keeper of hidden networks.  Zayne appears midway through the first
season, offering rare intel and a unique NFT that grants extraordinary
powers.  His origins are shrouded in mystery, and some suspect he belongs to a
larger organisation working behind the scenes.
