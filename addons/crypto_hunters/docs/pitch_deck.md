# Pitch Deck (Outline)

## Vision

Create a game where learning about decentralised technology is as engaging as
playing an RPG.  Crypto Hunters teaches cryptography, networking and
governance through missions and story, rewarding players with redeemable DRX.

## Problem

Web3 is complex and full of security risks.  Many newcomers lose funds to
scams or misconfigure their wallets.  Traditional education is insufficient to
make people resilient.

## Solution

Crypto Hunters uses gamification to teach security best practices.  Missions
mirror real‑world tasks such as verifying hashes or auditing smart contracts.
Players collaborate and earn game DRX, which can be redeemed on XRPL.

## Market Opportunity

The blockchain gaming sector is growing quickly.  There is a gap for
educational games that offer tangible token rewards while driving literacy and
community engagement.

## Product Demo

The prototype includes a Node/Express backend with mission completion and
withdraw queues, plus a mobile app built with React Native/Expo.  Players can
complete missions, earn DRX, purchase items and manage their inventory.

## Business Model

Revenue sources include item sales (cosmetics, boosters, NFTs), premium
subscriptions for advanced analytics or extra missions, and partnerships with
education providers.  Game DRX is capped; additional DRX enters the economy
through in‑app purchases or sponsorships.

## Traction & Roadmap

Early tests with closed groups show strong retention and enthusiasm.  The
roadmap includes launching the alpha, securing seed funding, releasing
playable seasons and, eventually, expanding into a full MMO (Argotera).

## Team

The founding team comprises experts in cryptography, gaming and education.
Advisors include blockchain security researchers and XRPL community leaders.

## Financials & Ask

Funding is sought to complete the MVP, audit the smart contracts, produce
polished artwork and run community growth campaigns.  A portion will be
allocated to liquidity for DRX on the XRPL DEX.
