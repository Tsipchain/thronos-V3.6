## Premise

Crypto Hunters is a Web3 role‑playing game where a small elite squad defends
decentralised networks from both digital and human adversaries.  The journey
begins in Greece in 2012.  SAfA, a curious hacker, discovers blockchain during
the height of financial turmoil.  Through trial and error, bull runs and
crashes, he realises that decentralisation can free people from centralised
control.  He assembles a team to safeguard this new paradigm.

## Acts

1. **Spark (2012):** First contact with mining; hard lessons after a bull run; reunion
   with Nato Saka.
2. **Formation:** Niva, Kyra and Luna join the cause; the Hunters thwart early
   exploits orchestrated by the Dark Node.
3. **Revelation:** Zayne Nexus appears mid‑season with critical intelligence
   about the scope of the threat.
4. **Uplift:** Greece pilots a decentralised civic stack; the Hunters face a
   climactic showdown against the Dark Node, hinting at a larger conspiracy.

## Themes

- Decentralisation vs. control.
- Education through play — missions teach real cryptography and security
  principles.
- Trust, friendship and resilience in the face of uncertainty.

## World Notes

The world spans from underground labs in Athens to improvised node farms in
derelict warehouses and clandestine data centres.  Civic hubs run open
governance experiments while dark markets attempt to monetise data leaks.  The
Dark Node operates from hidden relays and off‑shore havens, weaving
misinformation and technical sabotage.
