## Thronos Miners

This directory contains miner guidance for the supported mining contracts:

- **ASIC**: Stratum protocol (subscribe/notify/submit).
- **CPU**: Simple HTTP contract (`/api/miner/work`, `/api/miner/submit`).
- **GPU**: Placeholder guidance for dev/testing (same HTTP contract).

Refer to each subfolder for instructions and sample configs.
