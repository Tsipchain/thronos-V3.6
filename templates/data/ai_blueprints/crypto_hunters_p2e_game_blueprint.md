# Blueprint: Crypto Hunters P2E (Web Game)
Goal: generate a browser game + backend score submit:
- Frontend: HTML5 canvas or simple DOM game loop
- Score tracking + submit button
- Backend: API endpoint that calls existing Thronos /api/game/submit_score
- Anti-cheat basic: server-side cap + timestamp
- README with run steps
Output MUST be [[FILE:...]] blocks only.
